# Vagabond

At [Balanced](https://github.com/balanced), we use [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) for all our developer work. These are common settings, helpers, and utilities for facilitating `Vagrantfile` management as well as other virtualization environments.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:balanced-cookbooks/vagabond.git
```

## Why the name Vagabond?

It was either that or hobo :-D
